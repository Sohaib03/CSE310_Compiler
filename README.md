# CSE 310 Compiler Lab Submissions

Welcome to my repository containing submissions for the CSE 310 Compiler Lab. This project progresses through various stages:

## Symbol Table Creation
Implemented in C++ using a hashtable data structure. This stage lays the foundation for subsequent compiler phases.

## Lexical Analysis
Utilized Flex, a lexical analyzer generator, to tokenize input source code, converting it into meaningful tokens for parsing.

## Parsing
Implemented parsing using Bison, which generates a parser based on a formal grammar specification, facilitating syntactic analysis.

## Intermediate Code Generation (ICG)
Generates intermediate code suitable for the EMU8086 emulator. This stage bridges the gap between high-level source code and assembly language.

Each stage builds upon the previous, culminating in a functional compiler ready for the lab assignments.
